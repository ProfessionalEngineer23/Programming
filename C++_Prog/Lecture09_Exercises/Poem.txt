Upon the cliffs so high and steep,
A lighthouse stood in endless sleep.
Its light would flicker, dim then bright,
Yet no one climbed to tend its light.

Evelyn, drawn by tales untold,
Sought glowing waves, both strange and bold.
She scaled the tower, cold and tall,
And heard a whisper down the hall.

A sailor stood in ghostly air,
His coat was worn, his eyes a glare.
He pointed out toward the sea,
Where glowing waves wrote mystery.

She tried to speak, but he was gone,
His shadow faded with the dawn.
Yet still the ocean hummed his loreâ€”
A secret lost, forevermore.
