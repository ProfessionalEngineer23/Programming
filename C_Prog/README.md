2. GCC install and use
3. Run C code using GCC
4. Makefile
5. Q6 Product of 2 arguments
6. From sand to C video:
Sand is the material used for making semiconductors.
According to the relative abundance periodic chart; Oxygen is most abundant as well as Silicon. 

Relative Abundance - The percentage of atoms with a specific atomic mass found in a naturally occurring sample of an element.

Semiconductor are materials which can act as conductors and insulators ie: Silicon, Carbon.
Semiconductors are used in diodes, transistors and microchips which are used in smartphones, solar panels or Electric cars.

Doping: The process of adding other materials to a semiconductor to change its conducting properties.
N-Type --> Is adding materials with extra electrons like Phosphorous or Arsenic which increase the amount of loose electrons and their flow.
P Type -->  Is adding materials like Boron or Gallium which have don't have loose electons but have space or holes in the valence bands of the atom.

Transistors: An electrical switch that controls the flow of electricity in a circuit. The transistor has a base, collector and emitter pins. When a small voltage is applied to the base pin, current wil start flowing between the collector and the emitter pins.
E.G: NPN - Negative positive negative 
     PNP - Positive Negative positve 
     FET - Field effect transistor 

Logic Gates- Tiny circuits that perform logic operations (Boolean Algebra).  
E.g: NOT, AND ,OR, BUFFER, NAND, XOR, NOR...
NAND gates can be used to implement all gates. 

Microprocessor - A large circuit consisting of smaller circuits made up of logic gates 

Machine Code - A language made up of instructions that a CPU (Central Processing Unit) can directly understand. Consists of Binary ie: B4 - 1011, 02 - 0010. Programmers use a higher level language called Assembly code to write machine code ie: MOV AH,02

c Language - A programming language a level higher than assembly language ie: printf("I love programming");

Sand --> Silicon --> Semiconductors --> Transistors --> Logic Gates --> Circuits --> Microprocessor --> Machine Code --> Assembly --> c programming language
